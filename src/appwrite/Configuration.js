// in below code we are using field name as featuredImage info abt that field is as follow must read to avoid confusion in future
// createPost() & updatePost() use featuredImage to store the image file ID when creating/updating a post.
// uploadFile(): When a file is uploaded, Appwrite generates a unique fileId, which we store as featuredImage in the database.
// deleteFile(fileId): Uses fileId (same as featuredImage) to remove an image from Appwrite storage.

// üî• How It Works Step by Step
// User Uploads an Image ‚Üí uploadFile(file) stores the image and returns a fileId.
// This fileId is stored as featuredImage in the database via createPost().
// When fetching posts, the UI gets the stored featuredImage (fileId).
// To display the image, getFilePreview(featuredImage) generates a URL to show the image in <img>.

// we can get confused btw slug and featuredImage as while deleting post in PostForm we are giving featuredImage but here we r saying that deleteFile(slug) so diff is that 

// as we know that slug is for doc id means entire row so with slug we can get title,content,image and if we just want to get image than we use featuredImage ryt
// ChatGPT said:
// Yes, exactly!

// Slug (Document ID) ‚Üí Retrieves the entire row (blog post), which includes title, content, and featuredImage.
// FeaturedImage (File ID) ‚Üí Retrieves only the image, since it directly refers to the uploaded file in storage.
// ‚úÖ When to Use What?
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get full blog post (title, content, image, etc.)

// const post = await service.getPost(slug);  // Fetch entire post
// console.log(post.title, post.content, post.featuredImage);

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get only the image
// const imageUrl = service.getFilePreview(featuredImage);  // Fetch only the image

// üî• Conclusion
// Use slug when you need everything (title, content, and image).
// Use featuredImage when you need just the image. 
// bcz in PostForm when we r dlting we just want to dlt image not untire blog so that's why we r giving featuredImage

// üìå When a user uploads an image using uploadFile(), Appwrite generates a unique file ID for that image.
// üìå Each uploaded image will have a different fileId (even if the same image is uploaded multiple times).
// üìå This fileId is stored in the database and used later to fetch/display the image.
